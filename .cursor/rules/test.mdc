test.md rules below

1. while addressing fail tests, always have a mindset that there must be main program core error to fix rather than awaken test expectations!!
2. Test cases should be isolated and clean no leftover even on sigterm. even the file creation and cli operation is managed by test files
3. Implement e2e tests for all features with real implementation
4. Create challenging, thorough test cases that fully verify implementation
5. Test cases should match expected requirements
6. Do not create/make test of tricks, simulation, stub, mock, etc. you should produce code of real algorithm
7. Do not create any new file for helper,script etc. just do what prompted.
8. Should not create another files other than these:
   - `test/e2e` and`test/unit` - tests files. FOLLOW test.md rules
   - `test/utils.ts - test utils to be used in test files.
